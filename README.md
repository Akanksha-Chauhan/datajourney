# datajourney
Hello, 

This repository contains all the projects I have worked on in the last 2 years. In 2020, I enrolled in the MS - Information Systems program at DePaul University, Chicago and chose the data and analytics concentration. Thereafter, I learnt a great deal about data and data analysis techniques/processes. I am a strong believer in hands-on experience and I feel that is the true way of learning. Hence, I am posting my data journey here for people like me who come from a non-technical background and are starting out new with Python/Data Analysis/Data Science.
